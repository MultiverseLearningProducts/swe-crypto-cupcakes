# SWE Crypto Cupcakes

Welcome to SWE Crypto Cupcakes! The feature branches in this repo represent the evolution of a sample app. Each week we can demo a new branch, look at what has changed and why:

1. `cupcakes-api`
2. `security`
3. `jwt`
4. `oauth`

The `main` branch is the same as the finished `oauth` project branch after the 4 weeks of delivery, so get started at the first branch to see the app from the very beginning.
